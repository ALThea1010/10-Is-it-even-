This program is designed to determine whether a number is even or odd.

Here’s how it works:

Function to Check Evenness: It starts with a function called is_it_even(num). This function takes a number as an input and checks if it’s divisible by 2. If it is, the function returns True, indicating the number is even. Otherwise, it returns False, meaning the number is odd.

Main Logic: The main() function prompts the user to enter a number, which it then converts into an integer. This is where the user interacts with the program.

Checking the Number: After getting the number, the program calls the is_it_even() function to determine if the input is even or odd. Depending on the result, it prints a message letting the user know whether the number is even or odd.

Running the Program: Finally, there’s a check to see if the script is being run directly. If it is, it calls the main() function to start everything.
